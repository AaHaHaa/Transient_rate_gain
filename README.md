# Transient_rate_gain
 This is the shared package to simulate pulse propagation in a fiber with UPPE

It solves the transient gain based on realistic rate equations.

I've been modifying the code to make it user-friendly since it was written for our Optica paper. Hence, the paper example codes might fail due to a changed coding format or function name. I'll fix them soon, but it'll take some time. If users want to try the code before I'm done, in principle, users can fix the bugs themselves with the help of readme.pdf in the /Documentation folder.
